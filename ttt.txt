first let's assign our keyword strings:
1. "Basic Ledger, Non-guaranteed scenario"
2. "Policy Charges Ledger"
3. "Your policy's illustrated values"
4. "Your policy's current charges summary"
5. "Tabular Detail - Non Guaranteed" [this one is perfectly fine]
6. "Annual Cost Summary"
7. "Current Illustrated Rate*"
8. "Policy Charges and Other Expenses"

now we gotta define custom headers for all of these:
1. Age|End of Policy Year|Premium Outlay|Net Distributions|[alternate scenario] Current Value|[alternate scenario] Cash Value|[alternate scenario] Death Benefit|[current scenario]Current Value|Cash Value|Death Benefit
2. Age|End of Policy Year|Premium Outlay|[Current Scenario] Premium Charge|[Current Scenario] Policy Fee|[Current Scenario] Per Unit Charge|[Current Scenario] Cost of Insurance|[Current Scenario] Rider Charges|[Current Scenario] Asset Charges|[Current Scenario] Total Policy Charges
3. Year|Age|Premium Outlay|Net Outlay|[Guaranteed Values][2.00% crediting rate and maximum charges]Surrender Value|[Guaranteed Values][2.00% crediting rate and maximum charges]Surrender Value|[Non-Guaranteed Values][4.25% alternative crediting rate and current charges]Cash Value|[Non-Guaranteed Values][4.25% alternative crediting rate and current charges]Surrender Value|[Non-Guaranteed Values][4.25% alternative crediting rate and current charges]Death Benefit|[Non-Guaranteed Values][6.59% illustrated crediting rate and current charges]Cash Value|[Non-Guaranteed Values][6.59% illustrated crediting rate and current charges]Surrender Value|[Non-Guaranteed Values][6.59% illustrated crediting rate and current charges]Death Benfit
4.

5. 5th one's header is fine - already defined in code
6. 6th one's header is also fine - already defined in code
7. Policy Year|Age|Premium Outlay|Planned Annual Income|Planned Annual Loan|Accumulated Loan Amount|Weighted Average Interest Rate|Accumulated Value|Cash Surrender Value|Net Death Benefit
8. Policy Year|Age|[What You Pay]Premium Outlay|
